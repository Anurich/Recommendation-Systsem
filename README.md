# Recommendation-Systsem

A recommendation system is a type of information filtering system that predicts and suggests relevant items or content to users based on their past behavior, preferences, and interests. The system is designed to provide personalized rec- ommendations to individual users, with the aim of improving their experience and increasing engagement. 
There are various types of recommendation sys- tems, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid rec- ommendation systems. Collaborative filtering uses user behavior data, such as past purchases or ratings, to identify patterns and recommend items that simi- lar users have enjoyed. Content-based filtering, on the other hand, recommends items based on the features and characteristics of the items themselves, rather than user behavior. Hybrid recommendation systems combine elements of both collaborative and content-based filtering to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations.
